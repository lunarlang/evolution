# Lunar Language Specification
Lunar is a **superset** programming language of Lua 5.1, which means it inherits all of Lua 5.1's syntax and semantics. Nothing in Lunar should work any differently if it compiled existing Lua 5.1 code.

**ATTENTION**: Lunar is still early in development! All syntax listed below is subject to changes until `v1` release, in which case it will never be changed.

**Disclaimer**: Existing syntaxes are **always** a candidate for changes, even if it's a breaking change. We will try our best to document them.
